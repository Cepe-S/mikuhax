# Player Hierarchy

All players who joined the game have their own player level.

There are 2 steps for common players, and 1 step for especial users who have authorization.

`Player` is basic level, `Admin` is administrative level who is able to operating the game, and `Super Admin` is super level who has permissions for operating the bot application wholly.

Admin players have yellow colored name tag in the spectator window, but Super Admin players don't have that yellow name tag.

Super admin players can ban other players, and use special `!super` commands.
