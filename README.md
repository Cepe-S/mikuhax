You need to prepare `headless token key`. You can get it from [here](https://www.haxball.com/headlesstoken).

If you got the token, you have to launch the application and input your room's configuration values.

Then, you can launch your own game room.

## How to Backup
Players' data are saved on `DB Server`.

And you have to keep a copy of `.node-persist` directory to preserve some bot data.

You can also check the log in `.logs` directory. These log data will be kept for 30 days.
