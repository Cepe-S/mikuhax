## How to Build
You need to install dependencies if you didn't.

You don't have to build again if you did it already unless any changes made.

```
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

## How to Use
You need to prepare `headless token key`. You can get it from [here](https://www.haxball.com/headlesstoken).

If you got the token, you have to launch the application and input your room's configuration values.

Then, you can launch your own game room.

## How to Backup
You have to keep a copy of `.node-persist` directory to preserve important player data.

All data would be saved in that directory and you can also modify them using text editor.

And you can also check the log in `.logs` directory. These log data will be kept for 30 days.
